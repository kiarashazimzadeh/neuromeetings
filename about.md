### <i class="fa-solid fa-road"></i> Our way up here
Isfahan Neuroscience Meetings were established in 2016 in Isfahan Neuropsychiatry Center, at Ayatollah Kashani Hospital located in Isfahan, Iran and the participants were M. Barekatain (neuropsychiatrist), H. Mohammadbeigi (psychiatrist), F. Rajabi (neuropsychiatrist) and F. Faghani (psychiatrist). The main focus of early meetings was new findings about the neural basis of human cognitive functions and brain changes in psychiatric and neurological disorders. Over time, experts and students with different backgrounds participated in the meetings and the topics were extended beyond **Cognitive Neuroscience** to include **Neuroimaging**, **Computational Psychiatry**, and **Machine Learning**. After almost 70 meetings, there was a one-year interruption due to Covid-19 pandemic from late 2019 untill the end of 2020. Again from the start of 2022, the meetings were started again and is continued until now.
